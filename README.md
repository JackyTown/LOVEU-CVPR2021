# LOVEU-CVPR2021

This is the code for track 1.1 and track 1.2 of competition LOVEU@CVPR2021.

We have two main models. One of them is $MODEL_NAME_1$ using similarity map, and the other one is $MODEL_NAME_2$ using comparably simple networks.(transformer, RNN, and CNN)

We provide the simple way to implement(train, validate, test using ensemble) our code below and if you have any questions, feel free to email me <jinwoo-kim@yonsei.ac.kr> :)
